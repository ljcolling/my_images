# About

This repository contains images that I can link to on my pages on Canvas. This save me the hassle of seperately uploading these images.

## Usage

The format for accessing images is **https://github.com/ljcolling/my_images/raw/master/FILENAME** where **FILENAME** is replaced with the file that is being linked to.
